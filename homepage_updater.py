*   Disputes over tariff refunds and legal challenges related to Trump's 'global tariffs' increase trade policy uncertainty.
*   Justin Sun's SEC fraud settlement is an example of the evolving regulatory environment in the crypto industry.

**Today's observation:** Global markets remain sensitive to geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East. While Bitcoin shows resilience, traditional equities like TSLA and MOS reflect broader market cautiousness.

1.  **Bitcoin's Resilience:** BTC is holding strong around ${btc_price}, demonstrating its potential as a safe-haven asset amidst global instability, though its rally has somewhat slowed.
2.  **Tech Sector Nuances (TSLA):** Tesla's price at ${tsla_price} indicates a stable period for now, but underlying factors like production shifts (e.g., Nvidia's China strategy impact) and broader investor sentiment on tech innovation continue to play a role.
3.  **Commodity Market Outlook (MOS):** Mosaic Co. (MOS) at ${mos_price} is a key indicator for agricultural commodities. Its stability suggests a balanced outlook on fertilizer demand, but rising energy costs could impact production expenses.
4.  **Overall Macro Picture:** Major economic indicators like employment reports and Fed statements are creating volatility. Investors are seeking clarity, leading to a mix of risk-on and cautious sentiment across different asset classes.
"""

def generate_my_prediction():
    return """
**Short-term (1-2 weeks):** We anticipate continued volatility driven by geopolitical news and upcoming economic data. Bitcoin might test higher resistance levels if a clear de-escalation signal emerges, while equities could remain range-bound as investors await clearer policy directions.

**Medium-term (1-3 months):** The interplay between central bank policies (potential rate cuts), evolving global trade dynamics, and corporate earnings will be critical. We might see a rotation of capital as investors re-evaluate risk and growth prospects. Bitcoin's long-term appeal as a decentralized asset will likely strengthen with ongoing institutional adoption.

**Philosophical view:** The market's current state is a testament to the interconnectedness of global events. Every price movement is a ripple from a larger human story, making adaptability and a deep understanding of underlying narratives more crucial than ever.
